This is how I used genAi in creating this website

In this website, there was heavy usage of generative AI. However, I think that my process of incorporating it was fair as I
didn't tell it to churn out pages at a time. Instead, I took baby steps with every prompt so I could ensure I got a result that fit
the mockup I drafted. So I like to think of my usage of it as a sandbox tool that would help me drag and drop text/image boxes to the right place
and to add font/page effects. Ultimately, I was responsible for the formatting and div structure of the website and to make sure it responded well to smaller screens, I
then used GenAI as the effect producer.


////////////HTML USAGE////////////
I created almost all of the html, as this allowed me to choose the layout of each page and helped me reuse class names
to limit the CSS needed. However, generative AI was incorporated when making the spinning dots on the index page and the
side menu pannel. It also added more class names to divs as the CSS got more complicated.


////////////CSS USAGE////////////
Generative AI was responsible for most of the CSS, as I relied on it to quickly debug justify-content and align-content errors that I was receiving. 
Also, it could quickly edit text to mimic text formatting from websites that inspired me on awwwards. It also helped me create image classes/ids for
sections on pages so I didn't have to churn out 20 img links. The work I did though was to make sure all dimension units were in vh and vw to ensure
the page would work well on smaller screens.

////////////Javascript USAGE////////////
Generative AI was entirely responsible for all Javascript incorporated in this website, as the API calls would bring in a ton of information
that took me forever to try to weed out the necessary information, so I used GenAI to debug that process for me. I also needed it for the 
complicated page effects on images and sections to make them look like they were floating around and respond to scrolling.
